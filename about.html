                    <h3>about</h3>
                    <p>The complex process of printed circuit board (PCB) production is a highly streamlined and automated process, yet the outcome is extremely customizable.
okolo is a project for the exploration of the artistic potential a PCB can offer beyond the electrical functionality.
Limited to a few different layers and materials interesting patterns and roomly depths can emerge from an artistic aproach to the material.
The textural details of the material layers offer a lot of different perspectives and the ?recipient? can receive these as different layers of information which can form a bigger picture in combination.
</p>
<p>An important aspect to this project is the usage of free open source software for creation of art and so all the artworks can be found as files on the github repository to send to a PCB company or even edit the artwork and improve or change it in the way you like. However you are welcome to visit the LaLagunaArts shop and buy a ready made PCB to support our work and the La Laguna houseproject.
